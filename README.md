## Folder Structure
Each folder represents a case study with three files:
- `case_study_1.md`: explanations and queries for the corresponding case study.
- `notes.md`: Additional notes and insights related to the case study.

## Usage
To view the solutions and data import scripts for a specific case study, navigate to the respective folder and access the corresponding files. These scripts are designed for use in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for executing queries and importing data.
